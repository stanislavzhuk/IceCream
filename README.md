Icecream - my team project for the HTML and CSS course at GoIT.

The project is an attractive and well-structured website for an ice cream production company. The use of bright colors and images of ice cream creates a pleasant mood and provides information that the company specializes in this product.

Thanks to a well-organized menu and convenient information placement, the website allows users to quickly find the necessary information about products, prices, and the company's contact details. The responsive design allows users from different devices to have easy and convenient access to the site.

Additionally, the website contains many diverse CSS styles that add dynamics and a modern look to the pages. Animations, transformations, and grids are used quite effectively to create an attractive and user-friendly website interface.

Overall, Icecream is an excellent example of teamwork with HTML and CSS that can attract customers and provide them with a convenient and effective user experience.
