Ice Cream is a team project for the HTML and CSS course at GoIT.
Where I was responsible for the Our Locations and Franchise modal windows.

The project is an attractive and well-structured website for an ice cream company. The use of bright colors and images of ice cream creates a pleasant mood and gives information that the company specializes in this product.

Thanks to a well-organized menu and convenient placement of information, the site allows users to quickly find the necessary information about products, prices and company contact information. Responsive design allows users from different devices to have easy and convenient access to the site.

In addition, the website contains many different CSS styles that add dynamic and modern look to the pages. Animations, transformations and grids are used quite effectively to create an attractive and user-friendly website interface.

Overall, Icecream is a great example of HTML and CSS working together. Working as a team, we achieved high results and gained enough experience for our next IT achievements.
